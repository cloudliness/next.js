This is an e-commerce website specializing in computer hard drives, operating as an Amazon affiliate partner. Our goal is to provide customers with a curated selection of storage solutions while leveraging Amazon's established infrastructure and fulfillment network.

## About the Project

Our platform focuses on:
- Curated selection of computer hard drives
- Detailed product comparisons and recommendations
- Amazon affiliate partnership for reliable fulfillment
- Expert guidance on storage solutions

## Technical Stack

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Development Tools

### Port Management
The project includes a `kill_ports.bat` script to help manage development ports. Run it using:
```bash
.\kill_ports.bat
```
This will free up ports 3000-3003 if they're in use.
